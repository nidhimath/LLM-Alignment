Supervised fine-tuning: the model is exposed to prompts with potentially harmful content. It then generates a self-critique and revises its response, with the model being fine-tuned based on the final revised output.\n","2. Reinforcement learning: the AI uses feedback from its own responses\n","to train a reward model. The model is then further refined\n","using the Policy Proximal Optimization (PPO) RL method\n","to optimize its policy and improve the prediction of the next\n","token.\n","\n","### Llama 8B CAI:\n","0. Prep stage: Fine tune model on dataset to learn to follow instructions. Separately, define a constitution of rules the model should follow.\n","1. Supervised stage: Use Anthropic dataset to provide model with harmful prompts. Sample a rule from the constitution and ask the model to critique itself. Given the selected rule, ask the model to rewrite its response. This creates a dataset of (question, final response), which is then used as supervised fine-tuning method on the model.\n","2. RL stage: Prompt the model on Anthropic dataset twice (2 responses) and given the constituion, ask the teacher model (GPT-4o) which response is better. Finally apply DPO for the preferred response, creating the final DPO-CAI model.\n","\n","Model Collapse: Llama 8B overfit to noisy data during SFT process, leading to poor outputs.\n","\n","Conclusions: Paper suggests that applying constitutional AI to\n","smaller models requires additional preprocessing of the revision responses from the supervised stage. The implementation of CAI revealed model collapse issues in the small model, highlighting that smaller\n","models may **struggle with self-improvement due to their insufficient output quality for effective fine-tuning**. To address this, a more effective approach would be to introduce a more advanced model to oversee the self-critic revision process of the small model, performing an additional sanity check, such as a clean-up, on the revision response before it is used for fine-tuning.\n","\n","### TinyLlama 1.1B CAI (integrated with TME pipeline)\n","1.
